# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Page Not Found Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15's App Router where an unexpected `Page Not Found` error occurs when navigating between pages, despite the pages being correctly defined.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when navigating between pages within the application.  The initial page loads correctly but subsequent navigation results in a `Page Not Found` error, even if the target page exists and the routing configuration appears correct.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between pages (e.g., from the home page to another page). You'll likely encounter the `Page Not Found` error.

## Potential Causes

The root cause may involve issues related to the App Router's internal routing mechanism, possibly due to a conflict in route definitions or improper data fetching,  This error is subtle and might not appear in smaller projects.
